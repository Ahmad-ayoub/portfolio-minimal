After graduating with a B.A. in political science and publishing a book at the age of 20 I found myself yearning for a change. I wanted a chanllege, a career of the future, and to become a better problem solver. This search led me to software development, a field I found myself deeply engrossed in.

Now, as a Full Stack Developer, I pour my heart and soul into crafting beautifully designed, functional websites that are as impressive to the eye as they are robust in data handling. My passion for software was ignited only a year ago and I always get exicted when I work on my projects.

In my free time, you'll find me tirelessly working on various projects, continually striving to enhance my abilities and knowledge in the industry. These projects, which I am incredibly proud of, serve not only as a testament to my skill and dedication but also as stepping stones to a flourishing career in the software industry.

Please find below a selection of these cherished projects I've dedicated myself to over the past year. I hope you enjoy exploring them as much as I have enjoyed bringing them to life.
