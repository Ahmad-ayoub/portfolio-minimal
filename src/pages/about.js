        Hi! My name is Ahmad Ayoub. I am a FullStack Developer with a keen
        interest in making beautifully crafted and functional websites that can
        wow your eyes and handle whatever data is stored in them. I got into
        software development a year ago through curiosity and to look for a
        career change and have absolutely loved it. Anyways, here are my beloved
        projects down below.
